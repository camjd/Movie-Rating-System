## How does a nested `if` differ from an `if-else` statement?
A nested `if` is different than an `if-else` statement because the `if` statement is actually NESTED inside of another `if` statement, instead of being an alternate choice. It essentially adds another layer to the T/F option available. A normal `if-else` statement would be T/F, but a nested `if` could make it T/F, T/T, F/T, F/F.

## What are the advantages of using `switch` over multiple `if` statements?
It's easier to both read and write. The flexibility of case statements allows you to test against a single value and have multiple outcomes. 

## How does the conditional operator simplify decision-making?
It gives you a test expression and uses that to determine true and false, either of which has a different outcome. It is simpler than writing a longer `if-else` statement, but at the same time can be confusing because of the way it's read.

## What is short-circuit evaluation, and how does it affect the use of logical operators?
Short-circuit evaluation is used with boolean expressions to stop when the first condition satisfies (true) or negates (false) the expression. It affects logical operators in the sense that you should place the operand that is most likely to be fulfilled first in order to save on computational costs.
